Although prefix can be defined on the fly by configuring ``**kwargs``, it
may be slow and should be avoided. Frequently used prefixes
should be declared in a configuration file located at standard
locations. Configuration file is in `yaml <https://yaml.org/spec/>`__
format.

Location of configuration files
-------------------------------

Configuration may be specified in any of the following locations:

Root (UNIX ONLY):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is inhereted by all users of the system

``/etc/psprint/style.yml``

User (HOME):
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**This is discouraged.** Maintaining configuration files in ``$HOME`` is
a bad practice. Such configuration should be in ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``.

\`$HOME/.psprintrc\`

User (XDG_CONFIG_HOME):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This variable is generally set to ``$HOME/.config`` on unix-like
systems. Even if unset, we will still try the ``$HOME/.config``
directory.

``$XFG_CONFIG_HOME/psprint/style.yml``

Local:
^^^^^^

In the current working directory

``.psprintrc``

#. FLAGS

   Following variables may be set as boolean value forms (yes, true,
   false, no).

   -  short: Information prefix is short (1 character).
   -  pad: Information prefix is fixed length, padded with <space>
      wherever necessary.
   -  flush: This is passed to python's print function.

   Following variables may be set to string values

   -  sep: This is passed to python's print function.
   -  end: This is passed to python's print function.
   -  file: *Discouraged* ``STDOUT`` gets appended to ``file``. This may
      be risky as the file is opened out of context.

   .. code:: yaml

      FLAGS:
        # short = False
        pad: True
        flush: True
        # sep =
        # end =

#. ``custom``

   The ``custom`` string is used as prefix index while calling print
   function Following variables may be set as string names or integers
   (ANSI Terminal colors)

   -  pref_color: color of information prefix [black, red, g, 5,
      light blue]
   -  pref_gloss: brightness of information prefix [normal, n,
      1, dim, d, 2, bright, b, 3]
   -  pref_bgcol: background of information prefix <same as
      pref_color>
   -  text_color: color of information text [black, red, g, 5,
      light blue]
   -  text_gloss: brightness of information text [normal, n, 1,
      dim, d, 2, bright, b, 3]
   -  text_bgcol: background of information text <same as
      text_color>

   Following variables may be set as str

   -  pref: <7 character long information prefix string (long form)
   -  pref_s: 1 character information prefix (short form)
      *Remember quotes for special characters*

   .. code:: yaml

      help:
        pref: HELP
        pref_s: "?"
        pref_color: yellow
        pref_bgcol: black
        pref_style: normal
        text_color: white
        text_style: normal
        text_bgcol: black
